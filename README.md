## Definition
<i>k</i>-means clustering is a heuristic method of vector quantization, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining.

The <i>k</i>-means algorithm is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It is a clustering algorithm that operates on n-dimensional data sets. The algorithm operates by choosing random centers in the data space, then fine-tuning the location of those centers by minimizing the sum of squared distances from the points of the group assigned to a particular center. It is an iterative algorithm, which alternately refines the position of the centers, then reassigns data points to the nearest centre, if necessary. The assignment of a data point to single center result in the formation of clusters.
