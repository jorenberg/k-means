<b><i>k</i>-means®:</b> <i>k</i>-means clustering in C++, Python, Ruby, and R.

## Definition
<i>k</i>-means clustering is a heuristic method of vector quantization, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining.

The <i>k</i>-means algorithm is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It is a clustering algorithm that operates on n-dimensional data sets. The algorithm operates by choosing random centers in the data space, then fine-tuning the location of those centers by minimizing the sum of squared distances from the points of the group assigned to a particular center. It is an iterative algorithm, which alternately refines the position of the centers, then reassigns data points to the nearest centre, if necessary. The assignment of a data point to single center result in the formation of clusters.

### The <i>k</i>-Means: A Centroid-Based Technique
The <i>k</i>-means algorithm takes the input parameter, <i>k</i>, and partitions a set of n objects into <i>k</i> clusters so that the resulting intracluster similarity is high but the intercluster similarity is low. Cluster similarity is measured in regard to the <i>mean</i> value of the objects in a cluster, which can be viewed as the cluster’s <i>centroid or center of gravity</i>.
